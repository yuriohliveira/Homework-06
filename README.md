# Weather Dashboard 

## Current and future weather data retrieved using server-side APIs. Features responsive design and dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

This application allows the user to search for a city via form inputs. The search returns weather data including temperature, weather conditions, UV Index, wind speed, humidity, and a five-day forecast. The user's search history is saved using localStorage. 

APIs and AJAX calls were largely used in this application, as well as Bootstrap for mobile responsiveness.

After searching, the current weather and five-day forecast will be displayed for that city.
